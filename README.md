A Pebble watchface that tells time with Morse code. The time is told every five
minutes in military time (four digits, left zero-padded, 24-hour clock), e.g.
6:00 am is `0600` and 11:17 pm is `2317`.

One unit is defined to be 75 milliseconds. Usual definitions of dit (one unit),
dah (three units), and gaps apply. As quick reminder, here are the Arabic
numerals as defined by the International Morse Code:

* 1: `.----`
* 2: `..---`
* 3: `...--`
* 4: `....-`
* 5: `.....`
* 6: `-....`
* 7: `--...`
* 8: `---..`
* 9: `----.`
* 0: `-----`
